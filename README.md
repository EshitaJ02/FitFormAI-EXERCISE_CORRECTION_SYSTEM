FitForm AI is a real-time exercise posture correction system that utilizes computer vision
techniques to analyze user movements. By leveraging libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system
will capture and process live video feed to detect key body landmarks and calculate critical angles. Based
on these angles, the system will provide real-time feedback on the user's posture, highlighting any
deviations from the correct form and suggesting corrections. Furthermore, it will accurately count
successful repetitions, motivating users and helping them track their progress. This system has the
potential to significantly improve exercise form, reduce the risk of injuries, and enhance the overall
workout experience.
